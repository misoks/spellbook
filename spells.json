This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can\u2019t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you. Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can\u2019t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn\u2019t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration. Targeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target. Areas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can\u2019t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. Spells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it. Magic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword. A magic weapon\u2019s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits. Magical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere. Creatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere. Dispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don\u2019t nullify each other.","duration":"Concentration, up to 1 hour","level":8,"range":"Self (10-foot-radius sphere)","school":"Abjuration","classes":["Cleric","Wizard"]},{"name":"Arcane Eye","casting_time":"1 action","components":"V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)","description":"You create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.

If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it. \n\nThe spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens. \n\nThe spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature\u2019s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature\u2019s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation. \n\nIf you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.","duration":"1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth","level":9,"range":"10 feet","school":"Necromancy","classes":["Cleric","Warlock","Wizard"]},{"name":"Augury","casting_time":"1 minute","components":"V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)","description":"By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes.

If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can\u2019t be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d100 and consults the table. Familiarity. \u201cPermanent circle\u201d means a permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. \u201cAssociated object\u201d means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard\u2019s library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich\u2019s secret tomb. \u201cVery familiar\u201d is a place you have been very often, a place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. \u201cSeen casually\u201d is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren\u2019t very familiar. \u201cViewed once\u201d is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. \u201cDescription\u201d is a place whose location and appearance you know through someone else\u2019s description, perhaps from a map. \u201cFalse destination\u201d is a place that doesn\u2019t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy\u2019s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists. On Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to. Off Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 \u00d7 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble. Similar Area. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that\u2019s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard\u2019s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane. Mishap. The spell\u2019s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).","duration":"Instantaneous","level":7,"range":"10 feet","school":"Conjuration","classes":["Bard","Sorcerer","Wizard"]},{"name":"Thaumaturgy","casting_time":"1 action","components":"V","description":"You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range.
